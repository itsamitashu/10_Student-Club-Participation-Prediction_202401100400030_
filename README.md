Student Club Participation Prediction Predict if a student will join a club based on interest areas and schedule. 
Student Club Participation Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a student will join a club based on their interests and available schedule. By analyzing features such as sports and arts interest, along with free time during the week, the model helps in identifying patterns in student participation behavior.

This project is designed to assist college event planners or student councils in:

Understanding student preferences,

Predicting club engagement levels,

Organizing more effective and targeted student events.

The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and the use of a logistic regression model to perform binary classification (Join vs Not Join).
